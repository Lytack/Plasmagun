# 🔥 Powerful Plasmagun Project

---

**Welcome!**

This repository contains the **Arduino source code** and **sound files** for the **Plasmagun Project**.

I've also made a **YouTube tutorial**, where I show you **how to build the device step by step**.
Some **electronics parts are briefly explained**, but the main focus is on **the building process**.

## 🚀 How to Run the Code

1. **Install the Arduino IDE**
   👉 [https://www.arduino.cc/en/software](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software)

2. **Prepare the IDE**
   Go to **File → Preferences** and enable:

   * ✅ Line Numbers
   * ✅ Verbose Output (optional, for debugging)

3. **Install Libraries**
   Open **Tools → Manage Libraries...** and install the libraries listed above.

4. **Load the Code**
   Copy the Arduino code from this repository into the IDE.

5. **Prepare the Sounds**
   Copy the entire `mp3` folder onto a **FAT32 formatted microSD card**.

6. **Insert the microSD card into the DFPlayer Mini.**

7. **Connect your Arduino via USB.**

8. **Select your board and COM port:**

   * **Tools → Board** → Choose your Arduino model (e.g., Uno, Nano)
   * **Tools → Port** → Select the correct COM port

9. **Upload the code**
   Press **Upload** (🔼) and wait until the transfer is complete.

## ⚠️ Important Notes

* The code works **out of the box**.
* Make sure the `mp3` folder is correctly placed on the microSD card.
* Insert the card into the **DFPlayer Mini** before running the system.
